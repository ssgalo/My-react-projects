# Welcome to 'My React Projects'

Simply I am a student who wants to learn.
In this case, I'll learn all about react and I'll be updating this repo with apps that I am building :)
<br />
In order to become a strong React Developer, I am following the Road Map provided by the roadmap.sh website <br />
Here, you can see what I am talking about:
https://roadmap.sh/react <br />

So far, I learned too many things like basik hooks (useState, useEffect), rendering in react, props, custom hooks, useMemo, useCallback, useRef, react router and conditional rendering. <br />
And now, I am learning about useContext and useReducer hooks.
